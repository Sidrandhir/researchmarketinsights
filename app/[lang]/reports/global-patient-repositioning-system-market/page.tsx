        <h3 style="color: #2563eb; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Market Dynamics</h3>
        
        <h4 style="color: #1d4ed8; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Drivers:</h4>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The world population is aging and the elderly are increasingly in need of medical assistance and care. This demographic change has led to an increasing number of patients requiring specialized solutions for variety of conditions, from orthopedic surgery to diagnostic procedures. These conditions are help to increase in the use of patient positioning system solutions. Additionally, manufacturers are launching a variety of products to meet the unique anatomical and physical needs of the elderly and chronically ill people, which is expected to boost the market in the foreseen period (2025-2031). Further, according to a paper published by the World Health Organization in October 2022, by 2030, 1 in 6 people worldwide are expected to be 60 years of age or older again, with that number rising from 1 billion in 2020 to an estimated 1.4 billion in 2030. Furthermore, the global population aged over 60 is expected to double to 2.1 billion by 2050. Hence the rising spending on aged people leading to boost market growth. Also according to Global Aging Project 2020, there were 727 million humans over the age of 65 within the global in 2020. Therefore, the aged health problems will result in an increase the variety of hospitals and the want for inpatient treatment centers, which in turn increases the marketplace in patient positioning system space.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">A considerable shift is observed toward patient positioning system solutions that can be customized to fit the unique anatomies of a patient and the particular needs of a surgical case. Modular designs, for instance, have gained increasing popularity in healthcare settings. Modular setups, which are largely installed within operating rooms, are prefabricated off-site, assembled on-site, and provide considerable options for customization. This trend entails creating modular adjustable, accessories, software-driven positioning features, and table tops, which empower healthcare professionals to alter the positioning systems according to the specific requirements of each patient and procedure. Adjustable medical accessories have become a more important aspect of healthcare infrastructure. For example, advanced/innovative beds are designed such that they adjust according to the needs of the patient to provide additional comfort.</p>

        <h4 style="color: #1d4ed8; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Restraints:</h4>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The US government has implemented a 2.3% excise tax on the domestic sales of Class I, II, and III medical devices under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. These impositions apply to any medical device manufactured or imported into the United States. Therefore, patient positioning systems market, being Class I and II medical devices, would witness some sort of impact in the United States. Since this tax would also lead to an erosion in the profit margins of the manufacturer, the cost of the medical device is anticipated to rise in the US. Such increases in price would also result in delayed purchase of new instruments, which would act as a partial brake for growth in the market. However, the US is a significant market for patient positioning systems. Thus, introduction of excise tax on medical devices would affect the global patient positioning systems market.</p>

        <h4 style="color: #1d4ed8; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Opportunities:</h4>

        <h4 style="color: #1d4ed8; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">By Product:</h4>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Tables are of utmost importance in a patient positioning system, offering flexibility and adaptability for a multiple of procedures spanning multiple specialties. Surgical tables, examination tables, and radiolucent imaging tables have adjustment functions for height, tilt, and lateral slide capabilities that allow healthcare providers to make individual adjustments tailored to each procedure. Important market players are proactively promoting their innovative surgical table to the market, which is expected to drive the segment. In March 2021, for instance SIMEON Medical collaborated with experienced end-users to design the Sim.MOVE 800, an OR-table perfectly suited for use in almost every condition. Therefore, these products find applications in a wide variety of typical cases, such as hybrid operating rooms. The availability of surgical tables that may be used interchangeably across varied settings is likely to drive the growth in this segment.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">In 2021 October in United states, Stille AB company has contracted with GE Healthcare company to launched a general surgery table. The GS2 general surgery table was designed specifically to be able to fulfil growing demand for a premium option that caters to multi-disciplinary surgery units like Ambulatory Surgery Centers, but which is a cost-effective & high-value solution. Such collaborations with a focus on surgical tables marketing, will further adoption of these products are thus encouraging growth of the market.</p>

        <h4 style="color: #1d4ed8; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">By Application:</h4>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Patient positioning systems market is bifurcated into several applications among them are Surgeries, Disease Diagnosis, Cancer Therapy. Of these, the Surgeries segment is expected to be dominating in the forecasted period. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, update in May 2022, Norway conducted 19,201 and Denmark conducted 54,836 surgeries in 2020. The overwhelming number of surgeries in these developed European countries will lead to an increased demand for patient positioning devices needed during operations, which will fuel market growth. Further, according to a December 2021 report, increased demand coupled with improved access to surgery across Asia will fuel explosive growth of both surgical procedure volume as well as the medical equipment market. While China is considered one of the growth hubs, other emerging markets include India and Southeast Asia. High demand and rising numbers of surgical procedures in countries that are either densely populated or both densely populated and developing, such as India and China, would translate to the higher use of surgical tables for patient positioning, hence propelling the growth of this market segment. Hence, based on the factors elucidated above, significant growth is expected for this segment throughout the projection period.</p>

        <h3 style="color: #2563eb; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Regional Insights</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">In North America, the patient positioning system market is expected to retain its significant share, both in revenue as well as demand. This dominance comes from the quicker acceptance of advanced medical procedures and the increasingly diagnosed chronic diseases among the aging people in this region. According to the U.S. According to the Census Bureau, in the year 2021, of the 328 million people in the U.S, 75 million were above 60 years old. The percentage of the elderly population is expected to rise over time, this may mean a significant portion of the population can fall prey to chronic and acute health conditions that may spur higher demand for surgeries. Europe is expected to be one of the most promising markets for patient positioning systems, considering the increasing opportunities in the regions.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The increased concern for patient safety in surgical procedures is anticipated to strongly increase the demand for patient positioning systems in Europe. The European Commission has also released a new medical device identification system based on the xUDI (extensible Unique Device Identifier). This system will help identify products more easily and accurately. The demand in the Asia Pacific market is also likely to grow at the highest rate, due to the improving healthcare infrastructure of its emerging economies. Similarly, the region of MEA is expected to behave in the same manner; however, lack of awareness about these systems poses a significant challenge in terms of addressing them so that their complete potential can be analysed.</p>
